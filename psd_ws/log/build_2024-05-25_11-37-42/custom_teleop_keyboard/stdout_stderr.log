[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findament_lint_auto.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ament_lint_auto", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ament_lint_auto"
  with any of the following names:

    ament_lint_autoConfig.cmake
    ament_lint_auto-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ament_lint_auto" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or
  set "ament_lint_auto_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.
  If "ament_lint_auto" provides a separate development package or SDK, be
  sure it has been installed.
